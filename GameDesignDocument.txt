Concept:
Tanks fight head-to-head on an enclosed map
First Tank to destroy the other Tank wins

Rules:
Both players begin with the same health
The game finishes when one player's health reaches 0 (death)
The speed of the tank and the motion of the turret is limited

Requirements:
A tank model with a body, turret, barrel, and tracks for movement
An enclosed landscape with textures
Terrain for gameplay and cover
Controller setup (WASD for tank motion and mouse for camera control,
spacebar for shooting? Any special projectiles?)
